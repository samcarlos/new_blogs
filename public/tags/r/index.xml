      <description>hete is the wild west of analytics. no wrong answers yet - Bill Lattner
Intro Generally lift models use a Qini coefficient to measure the performance of a model. However this metric is generally an indirect measure of what the user wants to achieve: profit. In this post Iâ€™ll discuss a measure of profitability in lift models. A neural network can optimize this cost function directly. A comparison between this method compared with a causal tree implementation shows promising results.</description>

      <description>Intro: How much has bitcoin made Society? This post will calculate the realized gains of bitcoin (up to year 2013) as a measure of how much society has made off of bitcoin.
 How are realized gains different from market capitalization? Realized gains measure the amount of money people can claim to have made off of bitcoin. This can be markedly different from the market capitalization.
For instance suppose we have two stocks A and B both with 100 shares and both with a price of $1 at time t_0.</description>

      <description>Previous Results Overall car sales for the month 5.7% lower than expected (predicted: 1436262, actual: 1356218). Porsche (new Cayenne and Panamera), Buick (Enclave and LaCrosse showed large gains), and Maserati (Levante) all showed strong growth.
Volvo saw weak numbers compared to the previously high growth they experienced. Both the XC60 and XC90 were expected to increase to 2200 and 3400 cars but fell to 1888 and 2550.
Audi was the most accurate prediction.</description>
