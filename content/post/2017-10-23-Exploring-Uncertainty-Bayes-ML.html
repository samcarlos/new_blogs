<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Bayesian machine learning techniques allow us to obtain a posterior density for individual predictions instead of just the mean. This additional information allows us to understand and explore the uncertainty involved. However not all uncertainties are the same; one could be certain the mean of a predicted value is a certain value but there could be high variance or one can not be certain of a particular prediction because the training set didn’t include values like the predicted input. This post will explore these two types of uncertainty and see if:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>these methods can calculate the variance of the dataset itself and</li>
<li>how this compares with uncertainty of a value it hasn’t seen before (low support regions in data)</li>

<h2>Data Setup:</h2>
<p>I generated a dataset with the variance of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> but with zero mean as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x = sequence(-10,10,.1)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[ y = normal(0, sin(x) +2) \]</span></p>
